# Introduction
Hi! My name is Jie Chen and I'm currently studying @ RIT. \
I'm a DSA enthusiast and an ongoing competitive programmer. \
Currently on RIT ICPC Team. Attended 2023 - 2024 ICPC NENA Regional and received 11th place (Bronze Medal) \
I have 3 Leetcode accounts:
- [JustJie](https://leetcode.com/JustJie/) (Main Account)
- [SleepyJie](https://leetcode.com/SleepyJie/) (Smurf 1)
- [TiredJie](https://leetcode.com/TiredJie/) (Smurf 2)

I personally have 3 accounts because I really like to do leetcode contests and at times I would be very tired/sleepy or just not feeling it, that's when I will hop on those 2 smurf accounts. Here are some stats: \
Problem Solved: <572><731><250><1553> (JustJie) \
Contest Rating: <2552><2678><2538>

# Overview
I will be splitting this repository into 2 parts:
- Problem
- Contest

## [Problem](Problem/)
For problem section, I will sort them based on their leetcode difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. For each problem, I will write out the code as well as the explanation for the problem. Each explanation will be in the following format:
1. Code
2. Explanation
3. Time Complexity
4. Reasoning for Time Complexity

However, there might be times when the explanation is incomplete. That would only happen if I can't think of the best way to explain the current question.

## [Contest](Contest/)
For contest section, it's just going to be a storage area for my contest code and will not have explanation because it might or might not be well written.

## Script used to Organize
Notice that I have 3 python scripts in the source directory:
1. make.py
2. fetcher.py
3. organizer.py

They are used to create directories for me and add the information into their respective README.MD. In order to also use this, your directory must be in the following format

- Problem (Folder)
  - Easy (Folder)
  - Medium (Folder)
  - Hard (Folder)
  - Temp (Folder)
    - code.cpp (or whatever template you want to put here)
    - README.ME (Optional. Only if you also want to explain)
  - README.MD
    - It must be in the same format as mine.
- Contest (Folder)
  - README.MD
    - It must be in the same format as mine.

You can use the script by:
1. python3 make.py [problem_link]
2. python3 make.py [contest_link]

Examples:
```
python3 make.py https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-27

python3 make.py https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

python3 make.py https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions/

python3 make.py https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-391/
```

There will be 3 possibilities:
1. You've never done such contest/problem, so the script will create the folder for you and have the path copied to your clipboard. What I like to do is just `code [path]` so I can immediately start coding it in my IDE (VSCode).
2. You've already doen such contest/problem, the script will not create extra folder, it will just copy the path to your clipboard.
3. Tell you the link is not good.
